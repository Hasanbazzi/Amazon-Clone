# Amazon-Clone
I made this project to understand the fundimentals of Java Spring Boot and to improve more on the Frontend side using ReactJs .<br><br>
Things ive done in this project : <br><br>
Back-End Side : - CRUD methods for the product model , tested the APIs using postman .<br>
                - Login Authentication using JWT tokens .<br><br>
Front-End Side : - Used Hook in order to get the added products information and to share it with the Checkout Page .<br>
                 - Used Props to share enough properties between components .<br>
                 - Incrementing the basket everytime a user adds a product . <br>
                 - And of course , enough design to look similar to the one and only Amazon.com .<br>
